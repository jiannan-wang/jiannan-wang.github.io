Welcome! :)

I am currently a third-year postgraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of [Prof. Penghui Huang](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn/FacultyDetail.aspx?id=55&infoid=66&flag=66). My master's research focuses on inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, particularly on motion compensation and parameter estimation. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2022. 

I am excited to begin my Ph.D. journey at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) on September 2025, Hong Kong SAR, under the supervision of [Prof. Xianghao Yu](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~alexyu/index.html). My research interests include wireless sensing, signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI). My objective is to enhance the perception of interested targets by using signal processing and AI technologies.
