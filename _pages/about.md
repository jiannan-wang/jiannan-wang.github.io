Welcome! :)

I am a incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), under the supervision of [Prof. Xianghao Yu](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~alexyu/index.html). I am currently a visiting scholar at Southern University of Science and Technology (SusTech), working with [Prof. Weijie Yuan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/weijieyuan.html).


I obtained my M.Eng. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of [Prof. Penghui Huang](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn/FacultyDetail.aspx?id=55&infoid=66&flag=66). My master's research focuses on inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, particularly on motion compensation and parameter estimation. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2022. 

My research interests include wireless sensing and communication, signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI). My objective is to enhance the perception of interested targets by using signal processing and AI technologies.
